How to test a word counting program:

I'd suggest a set of inputs to run into the program, and deciding beforehand what the result for each case should be. 

Have each set of inputs test one thing at a time so you'll know exactly what needs fixing.

Spaces:
"this is four words"
4

Tabs:
"this   is  four    words"
4

Newlines:
"this
is
four
words"
4

Hyphenated words (according to your definition; we'll count them as one word):
"Daughter-in-law is one word."
4

Contractions (we'll also count as one word):
"You're sure this'll count to six."
6

Non-words (can words contain digits? Or symbols? We'll say yes, so long as it starts with a letter):
"0therwise we would have to properly del!m!t punctuation @nd parentheses 99"

Having your test cases prepared beforehand helps you build a more functional program.
