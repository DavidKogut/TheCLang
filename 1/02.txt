The escape sequences and their results  are the following:
*Note: Results are compiler and interpreter dependant, and in the case of \a, system dependant. 
My results are compiled with 'cc'  and viewed with the 'konsole' terminal.

\a	Alert character. Does nothing. On older systems this would make a noise.
\b	Backspace. Deletes the character previous to the escape.
\e	Escape. Deletes the character after the escape.
\f	Formfeed. Like a page break. Text will continue on the next row at the same position.
\n	Newline. Text continues at next row at position 0.
\r	Carriage return. Returns cursor to 0 position on same line. Anything after this escape will begin to overwrite what was before it.
\t	Horizontal tab. What you'd expect.
\v 	Vertical tab. Seems identical to formfeed.
\\	Prints ' \ '.
\?	Prints ' ? '.
\'	Prints ' ' '.
\"	Prints ' " '.

You can also escape an octal or hexadecimal number to print out the corresponding character. \ooo \xhh
